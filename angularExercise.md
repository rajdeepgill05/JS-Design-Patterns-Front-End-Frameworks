# Angular Exercise

For this exercise, you will create a shopping app.

### Items

Your app should have a variety of items (at least 4) that a user can add to their shopping cart.

Each item should have a price, a description, a name and an image.

Each item should have a button or link that allows a user to add it to their shopping cart.

### Shopping Cart

When users add items to the cart, the cart should display the name, quantity and price of the all the item in the cart.

Your cart should display a subtotal that displays the total cost of all the items in your cart.

Users should be able to remove items from the cart.

If the cart has no items in it, it should not be displayed.

### Tips

Your items should be displayed using and Angular template

You will need to have at least 1 angular controller and 1 Angular service. 

The data for your shopping cart should be maintained in your Angular service.

Format the data using the `currency` filter.

You are likely going to need to use the following directives: `ng-repeat`, `ng-include`, `ng-controller`, `ng-app`, `ng-src`, `ng-if`, `ng-click` and more, depending on how you construct your app. Make sure you review the documentation, or try Googling when you run into some troubles.

You can include the Angular Javascript file directly in your HTML by either downloading it or linking directly to it. We will NOT be using any build tools or package managers for this exercise. You can download it here: https://angularjs.org/
