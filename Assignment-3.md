## Restaurant Ratings App

### Description

You will create a restaurant ratings app. People will be able to to go to your site and add ratings for a restaurant found in your app.

### Requirements

- Each restaurant should have the following information displayed: `name`, `description`, `image`, and `rating` which begins at a default of 3.
- Users can increase of decrases the restaurant rating by 1 with the help of buttons, links, images etc. 
- When the restaurant rating gets below 2 a background or border of the retaurants containing element should update to a negative color, like `red`. 
- When the restaurant rating gets below 2 a new HTML element appears which contains a message saying that the retaurant is not very good!
- When the restaurant rating gets above 4 a background or border of the retaurants containing element should update to a positive color, like `green`. 
- When the restaurant rating gets above 4 a new HTML element appears which contains a message saying that the retaurant is super tasty!
- The restaurants rating cannot go lower than 0 or higher than 5
- Your app must be dynamic, use Angular.js, use 1 controller and a 1 service.

### Tips

The data for your restuarants cart should be maintained in your service.

You are likely going to need to use the following directives: `ng-repeat`, `ng-controller`, `ng-app`, `ng-src`, `ng-if`, `ng-click` and more, depending on how you construct your app. Make sure you review the documentation, or try Googling when you run into some troubles.

I recommend you add a CSS file this app to help with the background color changes.

Have fun. Make it look great, add something unique to make it your own. 

If you want to improve upon this assignment and extend your app, I'd be happy to discuss and help.
